\section{Introduction}

Dear editors and reviewers,

Thank you sincerely for your insightful comments. They have been instrumental in enhancing our paper, which we believe has significantly improved. Below, you will find a summary of the key amendments we made. This is accompanied by detailed responses to each review and suggestion, presented with the original comments in shaded boxes, followed by our corresponding answers. Additionally, we have included a diff file to illustrate the specific changes implemented in this revision.

\section{Response to the Associate Editor}

\subsection{General Report}
\begin{revquote} \label{sec:ae-response}
[Insert the associate editor's general report here.]
\end{revquote}

We thank you for this report. We find all the reviewers' and the editor's comments and suggestions very useful and have addressed them thoroughly.

\subsection{Specific Issues}
\begin{revquote}
[Insert specific issues raised by the associate editor here.]
\end{revquote}

Thank you for outlining these specific issues. We have addressed them as follows:

\subsubsection{Issue one}
[Provide your response here.]

\subsubsection{Issue two}
[Provide your response here.]

\section{Response to Reviewers}

\subsection{Reviewer \#1}

\subsubsection{Overall Review}

\begin{revquote}
[Insert Reviewer \#1's overall review here.]
\end{revquote}

We thank you for your thoughtful review. We have addressed your concerns as detailed below.

\subsubsection{Issue 1}
\begin{revquote}
[Insert specific comment from Reviewer \#1 here.]
\end{revquote}

[Provide your response here.]

For example, we have updated Section~II (?) to include the requested information.\io

% Explanation of \qo and \io usage:
% The \qo command is used here to indicate that the section number may have changed during revision, and we need to verify it before final submission.
% The \io command indicates that we have announced a change to the reviewers, but it has not yet been implemented in the paper. This should be removed once the change is made.

\subsubsection{Issue 2}
\begin{revquote}
[Insert specific comment from Reviewer \#1 here.]
\end{revquote}

[Provide your response here.]

As mentioned in the original manuscript:

\begin{quotepaper}
Future work will focus on improving the robot's autonomy.
\end{quotepaper}

% Explanation:
% The 'quotepaper' environment is used to cite the old or revised version of the paper.

In their seminal work, Smith and Jones stated:

\begin{externalquote}[c]{Smith and Jones}
Artificial intelligence is the new electricity, revolutionizing industries, transforming economies, and shaping the future of human progress.
\end{externalquote}

% Explanation:
% The 'externalquote' environment is used to quote excerpts from other sources than the reviewers' comments and the paper itself.
% It now uses all the fields:
% 1. The text is aligned to the center (c).
% 2. The author's name "Smith and Jones" is attributed and aligned based on the specified alignment.
% 3. The text is enclosed in custom opening and closing quotes and rounded corners are used for the shaded box.

% Continue with other comments and responses...

\subsection{Reviewer \#2}

% Repeat the structure for other reviewers
